"""Deployment bootstrap the dashboard shell reads before it renders.

One server-derived payload that selects the runtime context: which deployment is
serving this URL, what kind of session it issues, which management surfaces it
offers, and, for a hybrid gateway, where its control plane actually lives. The
shell reads it once and gates navigation on it, so no page component has to ask
which mode the gateway is in.

Registered in both modes, and unauthenticated by necessity: this is what tells a
browser whether a sign-in screen is even the right thing to show. It therefore
carries no secret. In particular it never carries the platform token, and
``management_url``, ``data_plane_url``, ``docs_url``, ``terms_url`` and
``privacy_url`` are addresses an operator configured, not credentials.

The contract is shared with otari.ai, which serves the same shape for its hosted
deployment (mozilla-ai/otari-ai#1591). ``deployment_type`` and ``session_type``
name three values each, and this server produces all three of the first and two
of the second: ``hosted_user`` is a session minted by somebody else's account
system, which no build here does. The enum is the contract, not this
deployment's inventory.

# A hybrid gateway serves none of them: its control plane is otari.ai, and a

# ``providers`` drops. It is the deployment-instance surface over

# ``organization_providers`` appears, and is the per-tenant surface that
# replaces it: ``/v1/organizations/me/provider-keys``, the organization-scoped
# BYO keys #670 shipped. It is the one name here that is not its router's path
# prefix, because the router is nested under ``organizations``; ``organizations``
# stays a separate surface, since the roster and the credential set are
# different pages with different access.

# ``providers:`` block and ``/v1/provider-credentials`` still populate it with no
# page in front of them, which is #818's to close.
#
# ``organization_usage`` appears for a different reason: not a credential's
# ownership but a question that only exists once tenants do. The router behind it
# (``/v1/organizations/me/usage``) is mounted on both editions, but on standalone
# the organization is the deployment and ``/usage`` already answers it whole, so
