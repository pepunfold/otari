"""Google and GitHub sign-in for the dashboard (standalone mode only).

Two calls per provider, and the split from ``auth_session.py`` is the one that
file's docstring already anticipated: an OAuth sign-in is a redirect through a
third party, so the credential cannot be another field on the sign-in body.
What it shares with that endpoint is the end and not the beginning. A completed
exchange mints the same HttpOnly session cookie a password does, through the
same ``gateway.services.dashboard_session_service``, so everything downstream of
a sign-in is unchanged.

**The whole surface is public**, because it is how somebody who is not signed in
signs in, and both routes are throttled per client IP through
``throttle_public_auth`` like the signup and reset routes.

**Where the browser's part begins and ends.** ``/authorize`` mints a CSRF
``state`` and hands back the consent-screen URL; the dashboard stores that state
in ``sessionStorage`` and sends the person to the provider. The provider returns
them to ``/auth/{provider}/callback``, an ordinary path (a redirect URI may not
carry a fragment, so it cannot be the hash route directly) which
``gateway.main`` redirects into the dashboard's own callback page. That page
compares the returned state against the stored one and, only then, posts the
code and the state here, where the state is checked again against the row
``/authorize`` wrote. Two checks that fail in different directions: the
browser's binds a callback to the tab that started the flow, and this one binds
it to a flow this deployment started.

**And to the browser that started it.** ``/authorize`` also sets an HttpOnly
flow cookie whose digest the row keeps, and the callback refuses without it.
The code and the state share one redirect URL that the access log and browser
history both record; the cookie is the half of the flow that neither does. See
``gateway.services.oauth_service``.

**What this route decides, and what it does not.** It proves the person holds
the provider account. Who that makes them *here* is behind
``IdentityProviderPort``: this build resolves the identity against its roster
and refuses one it does not recognize, and an overlay binds a different policy
without editing this file.
