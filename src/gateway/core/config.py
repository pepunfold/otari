        The derivation drops the port along with the scheme: a relying-party ID

        Refused rather than stripped, because stripping would be silent and
        would be wrong for a gateway genuinely mounted under such a path, while
        refusing costs one edit. Any segment counts and not just the last, so
        pasting the whole endpoint (``https://host/v1/chat/completions``, the
