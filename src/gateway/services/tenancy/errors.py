"""Domain errors for the tenancy services, and the HTTP status each carries.

The platform maps roughly 25 exception modules to statuses in one central table
(`otari-ai` `backend/app/api/exception_handlers.py`). The gateway has no such
table and its routes raise ``HTTPException`` directly, which would mean a
try/except around every one of the tenancy handlers. Instead each error names
its own status here and one handler, registered in `gateway.main`, renders it as
FastAPI's own ``{"detail": ...}`` body, so a rehomed service keeps raising
domain errors and the routes stay thin.

The status is on the class rather than at the raise site because it is a
property of the condition, not of the endpoint that hit it: a workspace the
caller may not see is a 404 whichever route asked for it.
