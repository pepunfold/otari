"""The OAuth half of dashboard sign-in: an authorization URL, then a code exchange.

Protocol mechanics come from apron-auth, which owns the provider endpoints, the
code exchange and the userinfo fetch that normalizes a provider response into an
``IdentityProfile``. The platform moved onto it in mozilla-ai/otari-ai#1740 and
this module follows, so neither side keeps a hand-rolled copy of a protocol
neither of us owns. What stays here is this deployment's own part: which
providers are configured, which scopes are asked for, and where the provider is
told to send the browser back to.

**Who the identity turns out to be is not here.** That decision is behind
``IdentityProviderPort``, because it is the one an edition varies: this build
resolves an identity against its roster and an overlay may provision instead.
This module stops at "the provider says this is who they are", and the sign-in
route hands that across the seam.

**PKCE is on, and the ``state`` is checked here.** Both rest on one thing: a
``models.tenancy.OAuthPendingState`` row per authorization in flight, written
when the authorization URL is built and consumed by the exchange. apron-auth's
``StateStore`` protocol is the seam it plugs into, so ``get_authorization_url``
mints the verifier and ``exchange_code`` reads it back, and neither the code
challenge nor the state comparison is this module's own arithmetic.

**The row is bound to the browser as well as to the flow.** A ``code`` and a
``state`` travel together in one redirect URL, and that URL is written to the
access log and to browser history, so a row keyed on the state alone would let
whoever reads either finish the sign-in for the full TTL. So ``/authorize``
also sets an HttpOnly cookie carrying a random flow secret, the row keeps that
secret's digest, and the callback must present the cookie (RFC 9700, section
4.7.1). One secret per browser rather than per flow: a second tab starting a
sign-in reuses the cookie it finds, so neither tab's callback breaks the other.

What is this module's own is the two overrides in ``_provider_config``: the
presets widen scopes and, for Google, ask for offline access, and neither is
wanted here. See that function.

The browser keeps its ``sessionStorage`` copy of the state and still compares
it, which is not redundant. That check binds a callback to the *tab* that
started the flow, which a server-side row cannot do; this one binds it to a
flow this deployment actually started, which the browser cannot do. They fail
in different directions. See ``web/src/features/auth/OAuthCallbackPage.tsx``.

    Both matter only because the authorization URL is apron-auth's to build

    departures were invisible; adopting ``get_authorization_url`` is what makes
    them settings rather than omissions.

    **Scopes are pinned to the exact set in ``_PROVIDERS``.** Each preset merges
    its own ``BASE_SCOPES`` over what it is given, which for Google adds the
    long-form ``userinfo.email`` alongside the ``email`` already asked for. It
    grants nothing new, and it is one more line on the consent screen naming a
    scope this gateway did not choose.

    **Google's ``extra_params`` are cleared.** The preset sets
    ``access_type=offline`` and ``prompt=consent``, and the preset's own
    ``extra_params`` argument merges *over* those rather than replacing them, so
    this is the only place to drop them. Offline access exists to obtain a
    refresh token; a sign-in here reads an identity once and mints Otari's own
    session, so a refresh token would be a durable credential Google issued,
    this deployment discarded, and nobody ever revoked. ``prompt=consent`` goes
    with it: re-consenting on every sign-in is what asking for offline access
    obliges, and nothing here needs it.
