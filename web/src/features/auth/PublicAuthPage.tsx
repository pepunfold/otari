/**
 * One of the eight pages in front of a session, chosen by hash path.
 *
 * `App.tsx` mounts this ahead of its auth gate and keys it on the whole hash,
 * so following a second emailed link in an open tab remounts rather than
 * re-rendering: the token-reading pages take their token once, at mount, the
 * same hazard `AcceptInvitationPage`'s own key exists for.
 *
 * A page whose flow this deployment cannot run answers with a panel saying so,
 * rather than a form whose only outcome is a 503. The two OAuth callbacks say
 * it about their own provider, because "this gateway sends no mail" is the
 * wrong sentence for a person a provider just redirected here. That is the shell's own
 * answer to a gated-off destination (`AppShell`'s "not available here"),
 * applied here because the link to it is hidden on the sign-in screen and a
 * bookmark or an old message can still reach the URL.
