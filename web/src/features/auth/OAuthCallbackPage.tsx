/**
 * The page a provider's redirect lands on, which finishes an OAuth sign-in.
 *
 * Reached from `/auth/{provider}/callback`, an ordinary path the gateway
 * redirects into this hash route: a redirect URI may not carry a fragment, so
 * the provider cannot be pointed at a hash path directly. The query the
 * provider appended rides along and is read here, once, at mount.
 *
 * Four outcomes, and only the last one talks to the gateway:
 *
 * - The provider says the person declined, or it refused. Nothing was proven,
 *   so nothing is sent.
 * - The `state` does not match the one this tab stored. That is the CSRF check
 *   this tab can make, and the only one that can tell a callback apart by which
 *   tab began it; a mismatch means this redirect did not come from a flow this
 *   tab started. The gateway checks the same value against its own record, so a
 *   state that never came from an `/authorize` here is refused there even when
 *   no tab is involved.
 * - There is no code. A callback without one has nothing to spend.
 * - Otherwise the code is posted to the gateway, which exchanges it and sets
 *   the session cookie. On success this signs in exactly the way the password
 *   and passkey screens do, through `useAuth().login()`.
 *
 * Not a form and not retryable: an authorization code is single-use, so a
 * failure sends the person back to the sign-in screen to start again rather
 * than offering a button that would spend a spent code.
 *
 * Both endings leave this page, and both have to: `DeploymentRoot` picks a
 * public auth path off the hash ahead of the auth gate, so this page keeps
 * rendering until the hash changes, whether or not a session was minted. The
 * failure ending offers a link; the success ending changes the hash itself,
 * since there is nothing left for the person to read.
