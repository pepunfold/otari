/**
 * The hash paths that answer in front of a session, and what each one needs

 *
 * These are deliberately not files in `src/routes/`, for the reason
 * `AcceptInvitationPage` is not one either: every route there sits behind the
 * session gate `App.tsx`'s `DeploymentRoot` puts in front of the router, and
 * the whole point of these eight is that the visitor holds neither a session nor
 * the master key. `DeploymentRoot` renders them directly, ahead of that gate.
 *
 * The gateway agrees on the spelling rather than being told it: the
 * verification and reset messages it sends carry `/#/verify-email?token=…` and
 * `/#/reset-password?token=…` (`services/tenancy/user_service.py`), so a
 * rename here breaks a link that is already in somebody's inbox. The two OAuth
 * callbacks are the same kind of agreement for a different reason: the gateway
 * redirects `/auth/{provider}/callback` here (`gateway/main.py`), because a
 * redirect URI may not carry a fragment and so cannot be a hash path itself, so
 * renaming one breaks a URI already registered with a provider.

 * Whether a page's flow can work at all on this deployment.

 * `mail` means the flow starts by sending a message: `POST /v1/auth/signup`,
 * `/resend-verification` and `/password/reset` each call `require_ready()` and
 * refuse with a 503 when this gateway has no transport or no public URL of its
 * own to put in a link. The bootstrap publishes the same fact as `mail_ready`,
 * so the affordance is hidden rather than offered and then refused, the way
 * otari#648 already settled it for the invitation form.
 *
 * `oauth` means the flow needs the page's own provider configured on this
 * deployment: the bootstrap's `oauth_providers` lists one entry per provider
 * with a client ID, a secret, and a public base URL to build a redirect URI
 * from, and a provider missing from it can neither issue an authorization URL
 * nor spend a code. The sign-in screen drops the button, and the callback URL a
 * provider or a bookmark still reaches answers with a panel saying so.
 *
 * `none` is the pair a token already in hand reaches. Neither sends anything,
 * and the message that carried the token was sent while mail *was* configured,
 * so refusing them on today's setting would strand a link that still works.

 * redirects to `#/auth/<provider>/callback`, `publicAuthPath` answers `null`,
 * `DeploymentRoot` falls through to the auth gate, and the person lands back on
 * the sign-in screen with their authorization code silently unspent and nothing
 * anywhere saying why.
 *
 * The gateway guards its own half of the same pair at import
 * (`assert set(_PROVIDERS) == set(OAUTH_PROVIDERS)` in `services/oauth_service.py`),
 * and the nav registry guards its capability pair the same way. This is that
 * check, moved from a test into the type: adding a provider without its callback
 * path is a compile error rather than a runtime dead end.
