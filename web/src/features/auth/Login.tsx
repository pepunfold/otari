 * links. Every one of those lands within 14px of true center, except the
 * tallest, which nearly fills a 900px window anyway. Because the figure is a
 * constant rather than the content's own height, the offset does not move when
 * the disclosure opens or a refusal wraps; the card grows downward from a
 * fixed top edge. `max()` floors it on a window shorter than
 * the card, where the page scrolls instead.

/**
 * The sign-in screen, rendering whichever credential this deployment accepts.
 *
 * A standalone gateway takes the master key until an operator claims it by
 * setting a password, and email and password from then on
 * (mozilla-ai/otari-ai#1716). The gateway publishes which applies in the
 * bootstrap's `sign_in_methods`, so the form is chosen from that rather than
 * from a refusal: presenting the master-key box to a claimed deployment would
 * ask for the one credential its sign-in endpoint no longer takes.
 *
 * Below the form sit the ways in that are not a credential: claiming a rostered
 * identity, recovering a forgotten password, and asking for a fresh
 * verification link (otari#650, the pages in `publicAuthPaths.ts`). All three
 * start by sending a message, so all three are hidden on a deployment whose
 * bootstrap reports `mail_ready: false` rather than offered and then refused
 * with a 503, the way otari#648 already settled it for the invitation form.
 * Recovery is hidden on an unclaimed deployment as well: `master_key` is
 * published exactly while the operator identity holds no password (otari#702),
 * so there is nothing yet for the operator to reset, and the way back in is the
 * master key against `PUT /v1/auth/password` (see docs/access-control.md). A
 * member who signed up on a deployment its operator never claimed is the one
 * case this screen does not serve: it offers the master-key box, and they sign
 * in by calling `POST /v1/auth/session` until the operator claims it.
 *
 * A passkey signs in beside the form rather than instead of it (otari#652),
 * offered only when the gateway publishes `passkey` *and* this browser can run
 * the ceremony. OAuth sits beside both (otari#651), one button per provider in
 * the bootstrap's `oauth_providers`, which lists only the providers an operator
 * configured: a provider nobody set up is absent rather than rendered disabled,
 * and a deployment that configured none carries no OAuth affordance at all.
 *
 * Three decisions here are load-bearing rather than cosmetic, and each carries
 * its own note where it is made: the card is anchored instead of centered, a
 * refusal is rendered on a label row instead of in a banner, and the submit
 * button is never disabled for an empty box. All three are about the moment a
 * pointer is already resting on that button.
