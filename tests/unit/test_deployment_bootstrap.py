"""Unit tests for the deployment bootstrap the dashboard shell renders from.

The shell fetches this before it renders anything, so it decides whether a
sign-in screen, a management dashboard, or a data-plane landing page is the
right thing to show, and which credential that sign-in screen should ask for.
Unit rather than integration because the one database read the route makes runs
on the SQLite file each test stands up, so there is no PostgreSQL to wait for.
