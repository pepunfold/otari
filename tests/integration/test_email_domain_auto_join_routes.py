"""Auto-join over the sign-in routes themselves, not the service beneath them.

`test_organization_domains.py` calls ``auto_join_for_user`` directly, which
proves the rule and nothing about the wiring: delete any one of the three call
sites and that suite stays green while the feature dies on that route. These
tests sign in over HTTP instead, once per credential, so a missing call is a
failure rather than a silence.

The shape is the same each time. Ada is a member of the organization the
deployment boots (call it A) because every sign-in route refuses an address no
identity holds. The claim is on a *second* organization (B), so a membership
appearing in B is auto-join's doing and nothing else's, and Ada staying pointed
at A is the "never moves the pointer" rule observed from outside.
